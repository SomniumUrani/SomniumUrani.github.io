# About me
Who the fuck am I?

I am a weird guy that has a doubtable fascination of having
the control of everything. Thus I am aimed to be an embedded
systems engineer focusing on biomedical engineering because I
wanted to be a biologist and a scientist when I was a kid but
my parents fucked up everything as it's tradition.

I like to make things, I don't like to take courses because
in my geography happen that the teachers on technology subjects
are stupid boomers with no idea about what they are doing. Note
that my country has an educative system that award the ignorance 
and summision over knowledge and skills. If you happen to see
skilled people is always on boring stuff focused on making 
short term money. You would think that is ok if they need it, but
even on abundance they do the same.

Back to me, I like low level programming, mostly because I can
have the control of what is happening in my project. This 
is direct effect of stupid programmers that cannot do their work
well and you end up having errors that comes from the high level
language u choose or because over the program you are using, there
is a framework over an SDK over an API over an OS over a kernel over
a BIOS over a HAL over the actual CPU.

My workflow is just nvim with pure C on standard libraries in Arch
Linux (btw). I won't go deep here, it's just because I like nvim, I like
how programming in C is (you can think like the processor and that
is cool and confortable), and I like having just enough with Arch 
linux and a pretty workspace based on bspwm (now hyprland with its
weird copy of bspwm but actually better). Because I do not like how
mouse workflows are. Here a pic of my desktop because I want to see how
my vlog behaves on pictures.

If you are someone that I could like, you could have noticed that I
covered my WiFi SSID. That's because I am a cybersecurity maniac. I do
not know about cybersecurity but I always try to have the smallest
fingerprint on opsec generally, including physical activities.

I also talk italian, isn't that great? Non e questo bellisimo? Mi
dispiace per gli accenti, non conosco il teclado italiano e non lo
penso imparare.

I'm head of electronic systems at a Formula SAE team, but I'll tell you later because we 
don't know if I will still be part after the next competition.

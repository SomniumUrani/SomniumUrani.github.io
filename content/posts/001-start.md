# The beggining of my vlog
Idk what to sayl I'm just starting this Hugo website because I
have so much to say and there is so much absence of smart 
people in my life that I need somewhere to share my coding 
adventures and talking shit about windows, web dev, stupid 
people, VS code users, platform IO users, internet users, oxygen
users and so, like a Twitter but actually interesting and with bit
manipulation included and a superiority condition that u cannot
claim to be false.

I hope I don't burn my github pages with this thing, so share and
like this or something.

And I hope this doesn't affect my job seeking when a recluter
read this.

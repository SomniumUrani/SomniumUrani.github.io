# What do I do
## Talking
Che bello. I had to make a discourse from one day to
another and give it by memmory. I could not do it, I
had no time to make one and memorize it. In adition, 
I left the discourse in my PC and realized after I
left home.

I improvized in class. I think it was good, I got a 
90 but what matters is that I recived good response 
from the public, laughs are more valuable that a
note. It was the last project and represents 25%
of the semester so maybe the note matters a little.

What matters here is that this improvisation quality
I have is the characteristic that I know the least 
about me. I loved another last project of 25% but on
English class, it was about a presentation of 10 
minutes about the subject I want. I did an Art 
presentation and the spoken part was all made in
my head while doing the digital presentation. I got a
95 bc I said writting machine instead of Typing
machine, but it doesn't matter.

I am an autodiagnosed with autism, so being good at
speaking in front of the class in a forgein language is
not something you would stereotypically expect, me 
included. I have a long way to discover this quality,
I do not know under which conditions, about what or how
is when I behave the best on this situations. It makes it
difficult that I am finishing Italian course in one week
and the English one in one more semester.

## Biology and engineering

I am currently loooking to study Biomedical Engineering,
as you can see in my github and as my Instagram followers
know, if it happens that they open my vlog a second time.

I went to Biology school for hot chocolate and Churrous,
it was the christmas tree lighting ceremony. Now I
want to study biology.

I studied Biology when my age had just one digit, my parents
studied on Biology School, so I had a beautyful book that was 
taken away from me because they could not make it as biologists
and were afraid that I choosed Biology as my major.

I think I have a lot on my engineering path already, and I have 
not even got into uni. 

I concluded to go on the engineering, but how will I merge
that with biology, what am I doing to be happy by working with
low level programming and at the same time working with live things,
micro live thing, if I would choose. I also wanted to be a scientist,
something I remembered when in the ceremony the host said that she
wiches us a lot of papers for the next year.
